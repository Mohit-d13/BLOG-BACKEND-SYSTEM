## Description

A full-featured blog built with Django, MySQL, and Bootstrap.

## Core Features

- Post Creation and Management:
    - Users (typically administrators) can create new blog posts with titles, content, and publication dates.
    - Django's models define the structure of the posts in the MySQL database.
    - The Django admin interface provides a user-friendly way to create, edit, and delete posts.
- Post Display:
    - Blog posts are displayed on the website, typically in a list or grid format.
    - Django's templates allow for flexible presentation of the post content.
    - Views handle the logic of retrieving posts from the database and passing them to the templates.
- Database Integration (MySQL):
    - MySQL stores the blog's data, including posts, users, and comments.
    - Django's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) simplifies database interactions, allowing you to work with Python objects instead of raw SQL queries.
    - This makes it easy to create, read, update, and delete data.
- User Authentication:
    - Django's built-in authentication system enables user registration, login, and logout.
    - This is essential for controlling who can create and manage blog posts.
- Comments:
    - Users can leave comments on blog posts.
    - Comments are stored in the MySQL database and associated with the corresponding posts.
    - Django's forms can be used to handle comment submission.
- Admin Interface:
    - Django's admin interface provides a powerful and customizable way to manage the blog's content and users.
    - This includes features for creating, editing, and deleting posts, managing users, and more.
- URL Routing:
    - Django's URL routing system maps URLs to specific views, allowing for clean and organized website structure.
    - This allows for urls such as /posts/1, for the first post, and /categories/django, for all posts in the django category.
